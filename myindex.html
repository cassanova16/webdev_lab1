    <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
    <p>Hello everyone. My name is Testimony Chukwuemeka. I'm a computer science college student.</p>
    <p>
        I'm currently learning about Internet Technologies and Web Design. I'm excited to learn about how the internet
        works and how to create websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm looking forward to learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies. I'm also excited to
        learn about web design principles and how to create user-friendly websites.
